# Amazon Dataset Visualization using Amazon QuickSight

## Overview

This project guides you through the process of visualizing data from an Amazon dataset using Amazon QuickSight. By leveraging Amazon S3 for data storage and QuickSight for visualization, you can explore and analyze the dataset in various ways.

## Steps

### 1. Set Up an S3 Bucket

- Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store your dataset files (CSV and manifest JSON). You can use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI for this step.

### 2. Add CSV and Manifest JSON Files

- Upload the dataset CSV file and its corresponding manifest JSON file to your S3 bucket. The manifest file should specify the location and properties of the CSV file.

### 3. Configure S3 Bucket Permissions

- Ensure that the S3 bucket and files have the necessary permissions for Amazon QuickSight to access and read the data. This may involve setting up appropriate S3 bucket policies and access controls.

### 4. Set Up Amazon QuickSight

- Go to the Amazon QuickSight console and create an account or sign in with your existing AWS credentials.

### 5. Create a New Analysis

- In the QuickSight console, create a new analysis to start building visualizations. Choose your S3 bucket as the data source and select the CSV file you uploaded.

### 6. Build Visualizations

- Use the QuickSight interface to build different types of visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and more. Customize the visualizations based on the insights you want to gain from the dataset.

### 7. Explore Different Variations

- Experiment with various visualization options in QuickSight to explore different variations of the data. Utilize filters, groupings, and aggregations to gain deeper insights into the dataset.

### 8. Save and Share

- Save your analysis in QuickSight and share it with others in your team or organization. QuickSight allows you to create dashboards that can be shared and accessed by multiple users.
